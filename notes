Things To Note

CoreRecorder::recordAccess
    Sees the event record and pops it off of the "stack"
    Starts to spawn timing events and based on the type
        chooses to add children to the event or just delay
    
OOOCore::bll
    Reads the bbl input and starts to record the information in it

OOOCore::BblFunc
    Reads in the bbl that is associated with the core (given by a tid)
    ^ Cannot find where this is called
        ^ Seems to be passed on as a function pointer

Function Pointer Data Structures
    fPtrs[ associated with a tid ]
    When bblPtr is called this is the BblFunc
    Function pointers are called in zsim.cpp from line 168
        ^ The basic block function is called in BBL_InsertCall

vDSO ? (Line 718 in zsim.cpp)
